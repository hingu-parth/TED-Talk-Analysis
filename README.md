# TED-Talk-Analysis

TED is a nonpartisan nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages.

Given its recent popularity, there are numerous events being organised for TED talk and conferences and there are more than 3000 TED Talks currently available on internet.

A detailed analysis of the talks would be a lot helpful to the Current speakers, Potential speakers and TED talks Organization.

Our project aims at :
**Building a predictive model to analyse what would be the features of a popular TED talk**

The dataset that has been used for performing exploratory and predictive data analysis has been web scrapped from the official [TED Talks](www.ted.com) website.

The analysis will be performed using two data sets. The main dataset contains all the details of the TED Talks along with its speakers. The other data set will contain the content of the speech in textual format.
